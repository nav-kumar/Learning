## Projects

<img align="left" width="250" height="140" src="Images/dashboard.png"/> **[Creating a Dashboard with Python: Airline Flights Performance](https://github.com/muratko357/dash_application/blob/main/US_Domestic_Airline_Flights_Performance.py)** 

_Tools: Python, pandas, plotly, dash_

I have created a reactive and web-based dashboard application which enables interactive and real time visualization of the data, in this case, to visualize US domestic airline performance.<br/><br/>                                                                                                                                                                                     
       
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="F:\revenue.jpg"/> **[Tesla vs GME stock revenue Prediction](https://github.com/nav-kumar/Learning/blob/8717efcbb16be028cf55d4ba05ac63a590b92955/Final%20Assignment%201.ipynb)** 

_Tools: Python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, sklearn, time_

I have built a machine-learning classification model to make a prediction for stock revenues of Tesla vds GME. I have worked with the data Tesla and GME in order to run the model and get results. I have checked accuracy scores and computation time of various models to find the best model that fits the data, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.

## Certified Courses
- **[IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/MPY92MXFR9EA)**
    
    _Authorized by IBM_ <br/>
    _Issued by Coursera, 20 January 2023_ <br/>
    This IBM Professional Certificate is earned after successfully completing 10 courses on various topics in Data Science and Machine Learning. The courses included    working with hands-on with a variety of data sources, project scenarios, and data analysis tools, including Excel, SQL, Relational Databases,Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and Cognos Analytics, gaining practical experience with data manipulation, data analysis, and data visualization projects with python.
    The earner of this Certificate has demonstrated proficiency in applying different data science and machine learning techniques by analyzing real-world datasets, creating  visualizations & interactive dashboards, and presenting reports to share findings of data analysis, and is now equipped with skills for a data scientist role in data science.
